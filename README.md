## This repo is for my project to make Pacman

### The main features of this project are:
- Fully AI controlled ghosts of all four colours with the origional game's seek positions
- Being able to play as Pacman or a Ghost for an unique experience
- If you choose to play as a Ghost then Pacman becomes full AI controlled for a different game mode
- A top 10 highscore table
  - You can set your name from the main menu
   - Max 7 characters for a name
   - You can select one of 7 colours by pressing enter on the name enter option
- Fully working animations for Pacman and the Ghosts
  - In life and during death
- Looping around the screen when you exit from the left or right
  - This works for both Pacman and the Ghosts
- Fully working collision with the maze and other characters
- Having the characters being locked to the grid to prevent the player from becoming stuck in the maze
- Having a display in the main game of the player's current score and the current highscore
- A responsive score counter that, once it goes over the prior highscore, updates the highscore display as well
- A completed game loop, with deaths removing a life, and collecting a set amount of points awards you a life
- Audio implemented to give the game more of an interactive feeling to the game
